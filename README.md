# NLU Second Assignment
Repository for the second assignment of the Natural Language Understanding course 

Student: Andrea Rigo

# Requirements
`Python`, `spaCy` and `Jupyter Notebooks`

# Test the code
To obtain the outputs present in the notebook I used `Python 3.8.8`, `spaCy 3.0.5` and the pipeline `en_core_web_sm 3.0.0`. If you have different versions you could have different results.
